Windows tray program inspired by an Atari ST application of the same name.
This project was made in 2001 to try out tray functionality, play with Windows

## Building

Both the exe and optional DLL were built in Visual Studio 6.0. It would
probably take some effort to port this to a modern development environment!

## Running

but due to repainting you would see fewer crab trails. The effect is more
pronounced on Windows 2000 with the matching background color.
